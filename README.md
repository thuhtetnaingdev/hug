### üöÄ Introduction: Koa-based Framework with Dependency Injection

Our **Koa + Inversify** framework combines the lightweight and efficient nature of Koa with the robust dependency injection capabilities of Inversify, inspired by the structure of **NestJS**. This framework allows you to build scalable, maintainable, and highly modular applications, making it perfect for microservices, REST APIs, or any backend service.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:

1.  **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
    
    -   Built using **Inversify**, enabling powerful dependency management, promoting loose coupling, and enhancing code testability.
2.  **Koa Middleware**:
    
    -   Leverages the lightweight **Koa** middleware system for high-performance HTTP server handling.
3.  **Modular Architecture**:
    
    -   Inspired by **NestJS**, the framework uses **modules** and **decorators** to organize code, making it easy to extend and maintain.
4.  **Scalable and Flexible**:
    
    -   The structure is designed to scale seamlessly with your application's needs while remaining lightweight and efficient.
